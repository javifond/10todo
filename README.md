10-ToDo is a simple ten task manager which pretends to help user with common daily stuffs. It allows only ten tasks pending, the reason is quite simple, to be organized implies do things in a certain order and amount of tasks for every goal.

10-ToDo is based on HTML5, CSS3 and JS, using Local Storage to manage and store user tasks, this means that if for some reason user clean Local Storage pending tasks will be lost.
